            Without different views and opinions the world of research would become stagnant. 
            By limiting who has the right to education we limit what we can develop. Before machines 
            could do our thinking for us they had to be taught how to think, and before that we relied 
            on human power alone. Some of the greatest scientific leaps in the mid-20th century were 
            devised from human computers.

            In 1915 the “National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics” (NACA) was formed in the united 
            states <a class="NavLink" href="#Macalester"><b>(Macalester 2021)</b></a> in which the 
            Langley Research Centre was eventually integrated. This is where Dorothy Vaughan joined in 
            1943 and was assigned to the west wing computers <a class="NavLink" href="#Spelman"><b>(Spelman College 2016)</b></a>. 
            The west wing computers were an “all-black group of female mathematicians” 
            <a class="NavLink" href="#NASADV"><b>(Nasa 2017)</b></a> as during this time there was huge 
            segregation between black and white people in America. Jim crow laws wouldn’t legally be 
            abolished until 1965 so Dorothy and others like her faced huge opposition to get to their 
            positions. In 1940 only 2% of black women held a college degree and of that percentage 56.9% 
            were in teaching roles <a class="NavLink" href="#McDaniel"><b>(McDaniel et al. 2011)</b></a>. 
            The west wing computers, including at one point the acclaimed Katherine Johnson who went on 
            to provide calculations that were used in numerous NACA/NASA missions notably John Glenn’s 
            first human orbit of the earth <a class="NavLink" href="#NASAKJ"><b>(NASA 2020)</b></a>, 
            began to both individually and as a group distinguish themselves by contributing to all areas 
            of Langley research <a class="NavLink" href="#NASADV"><b>(Nasa 2017)</b></a>. She further 
            defied odds by becoming the first black supervisor in NACA where she would hold the position 
            for nearly a decade. Being adept at navigating racial, gendered and social obstacles she 
            furthered equality for everyone as Langley began to removed or ignore “colored” signs 
            through-out the facility <a class="NavLink" href="#Shetterly"><b>(Shetterly 2017)</b></a> 
            as well as intervening on the “behalf of white computers in other groups who deserved 
            promotions or pay raises” <a class="NavLink" href="#NASADV"><b>(Nasa 2017)</b></a>. 
            1958 NACA transitioned into becoming NASA Dorothy saw the opportunities and taught herself 
            and others FORTRAN, in which she became an expert, and became involved in the SCOUT launch 
            program <a class="NavLink" href="#NASADV"><b>(Nasa 2017)</b></a>.

            This is all to say that Dorothy Vaughan didn’t create a new programming language or changed 
            the fundamentals of coding, however she was a great computer scientist, transitioning from 
            human to digital computer work and paved the way for many to come. Her own contributions 
            helped lift science into a new age of development while the legacy she left behind has 
            allowed thousands to follow in her footsteps.
