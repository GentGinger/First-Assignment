            Computational thinking came with both technical information and advice on how to change the 
            way I think. The fundamental technical knowledge provides me with a base understanding on 
            how the machines I use work, how the languages I plan on learning are similar and show 
            patterns of the same workings, and establishing the basics of webpage creation. The advice 
            on learning how to retrain my thinking includes the method of <a class="NavLink" href="Computational Thinking.html"><b>computational thinking </b></a> 
            and how before any coding begins a thorough plan needs to be made.

            The technical parts of the module involved learning how number systems works along with 
            types of system like base 10, binary, and hexadecimal. After being initially hesitant about 
            the work after explanation I found that the logical nature of it made it make sense and was 
            much more comfortable about it. I still have doubts to the usefulness of learning binary in 
            a manual fashion but am still glad for the knowledge. In future learning I can use this as 
            foundational knowledge to build upon. Included in technical knowledge would be the sections 
            on HTML and CSS in which I learnt the basics of web page development. I’ve found this to be 
            that hardest part of the module as it’s the newest information and the most technical part 
            too. I have struggled with the understanding but have tried to push through. Going forward 
            I’ll use the learning strategies I’ve had to implement into other modules.

            Going into this course I felt nervous and concerned by my lack of prior knowledge. Having 
            no starting place was daunting and especially knowing how much would be needed. The module 
            made it very easy to come into as the first week provided a clear basis on which to improve 
            upon. From that first section I can take forward the concepts of computational thinking, 
            decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm design and apply it to many 
            aspects of my work and some aspects of life. The part I found most useful was learning 
            “Benny code” as the pseudo coding language gave me the practical implementation of the 
            theory of the week previous. Having the flexibility and simplicity of pseudocode gave me 
            more confidence to get started than if I had been given a full language straight away. 
            Moving forward through the course I will be taking the principles of writing in plain 
            English or a basic script to build upon.
