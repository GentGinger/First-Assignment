        <p class="ParagraphText">The term computational thinking was first penned by Seymour Papert in his book 
            Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas in 1980 <a class="NavLink" href="#Papert"><b>(Papert, 1980)</b></a> but 
            never defines it explicitly. In 2006 Janette Wing brought the phrase back stating
            “CT involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behaviour,
            by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science” <a class="NavLink" href="#Wing"><b>(Wing, 2006)</b></a>. 
            Tabesh <a class="NavLink" href="#Tabesh"><b>(2017)</b></a> writes that there are fours stages involved in computational thinking 
            that have mostly been agreed upon; Decomposition; Pattern recognition; Abstraction; 
            and Algorithm Design (which are built upon Papert’s original design).

        <ol>
            <li><b>Decomposition</b> involves taking a problem and breaking it down into smaller more 
                manageable problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Pattern recognition</b> does as it says as the intention it to be able to recognise 
                trends in data and patterns in work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Abstraction</b> is keeping hold of the relevant information and ignoring information 
                that makes solving the problem more convoluted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Algorithm Design </b> is planning the steps by which a problem is solved taking the 
                form of a simple order of instructions using pseudocode or a flow chart instead.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="ParagraphText">
            Computational thinking will be the basis for all my future coding work. Without writing 
            any code the problem will have to first be broken down into its constituent parts. Patterns, 
            similarities and repetition can be spotted within the tasks to make the work shorter. Going 
            down unnecessary paths and dead ends can be stopped using abstraction. Once the details have 
            been worked out, finally a plan can be made for a step by step solution, and given an 
            algorithm the majority of the work is done it can then be translated into any language 
            needed. Computational thinking isn’t just a tool for a single language, it can be applied 
            to all and every language I attempt and beyond that.
